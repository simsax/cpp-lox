# cpp-lox

This repository contains my implementation of the Lox programming language, based on the book "[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)".

## Part I - Tree-Walk Interpreter

In the `part_I` directory, you'll find the C++ implementation of the first interpreter, which is originally implemented in Java in the book.

## Part II - Bytecode Virtual Machine

The `part_II` directory contains the C implementation for the second interpreter. I simply followed along with the book for this one.

## Challenges Branch

The challenges branch includes my solutions to some of the challenges presented in the book.

Feel free to explore the code and the history :)
